# Rowdentakehome

Hello All,

This is My DevOps take home test

Tasks 1 and 2 have been completed

I have added an event bridge to handle the triggering of the lambda function on the hour, every hour. This will turn off any instances that are running with the Name "RowdensTEST - holden" 

Task 3 is not currently done but i should have some time Monday to complete this and will update this README with the details if needed.

Look forward to meeting you all on Tuesday

Regards

Michael Holden
